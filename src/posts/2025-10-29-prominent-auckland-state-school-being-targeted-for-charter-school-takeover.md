summary: "A prominent Auckland state school, Kelston Boys' High, is facing an unsolicited proposal from a youth charity and former board member to convert it into a charter school, despite strong opposition from the school's current leadership."
lede: "A proposal has emerged to transform Kelston Boys' High School into a charter school from 2026, spearheaded by a youth charity and a former board member. This initiative proceeds without the endorsement or support of the school's current leadership, who cite concerns over transparency and the best interests of their students."

whats_fucked: "The most immediately fucked aspect is the sheer lack of transparency and apparent disregard for the existing school's autonomy. An external charity and a former board member are attempting a hostile takeover, complete with a pre-selected principal, despite the current leadership explicitly stating the proposal is neither 'endorsed' nor 'supported.' This unsolicited bid, launched during exam season, creates an 'unnecessary distraction' for students and staff. Furthermore, the school's concerns about the group's ability to genuinely collaborate with the community and staff suggest a fundamental disconnect, implying a top-down imposition rather than a genuine partnership. It's a proper mess."
what_might_unfuck: "The upcoming consultation in November offers a slim chance for the Charter School Authorisation Board to genuinely heed the unequivocal opposition from Kelston Boys' High leadership, staff, and community. Should the board prioritise the school's stated best interests and concerns about transparency, they could reject the proposal. Alternatively, sustained, vocal opposition from parents and students, beyond the 75% positive feedback claimed by BEWT, might compel the trust to withdraw their unsolicited bid, allowing the school to continue its self-professed 'quality education' without such disruptive interference."
odds_unfucking: "Negligible. With $153 million earmarked for charter school expansion, a pre-selected principal, and a government clearly committed to this model, the momentum suggests this train is already well on its way. The 'consultation' feels more like a procedural hurdle than a genuine opportunity for reversal. The system is rigged, and it’s thoroughly fucked."

Ah, the familiar dance of 'improvement' descends upon another unsuspecting institution. One must admire the sheer brass neck of Bangerz Education and Wellbeing Trust, alongside a former board member, swooping in to declare Kelston Boys' High, a venerable establishment with a roll of over 800, as fundamentally broken. Their evidence? 'Poor educational achievement,' naturally. This, despite the school's acting principal, Mr Samuela, asserting they are 'well placed' and 'strive to continually review.' It's almost as if the school's own assessment of its ongoing efforts is entirely irrelevant when a new vision, complete with a pre-selected principal, is ready to be imposed. The timing, during exam season no less, merely adds a layer of exquisite, unnecessary distraction to an already fraught academic period. One might suggest a little less 'wellbeing trust' and a bit more basic consideration.

Then there’s the delightful claim of 75% positive feedback from parents and students. One can only imagine the rigorous methodology behind such a figure, especially when juxtaposed with the school's unequivocal statement that the proposal is neither 'endorsed' nor 'supported' by its leadership, senior staff, or, presumably, any sentient being within the school gates. It's a classic case of 'we know what's best for you, even if you don't.' And let's not forget the school's storied rugby prowess – 14 Auckland championships! Perhaps the charter school model will focus on optimising forward pack statistics, rather than merely educational outcomes. After all, what truly matters in a prominent Auckland boys' school?

The lack of transparency, a phrase uttered by Mr Samuela himself, rings with a weary familiarity. An external group, not affiliated with the school, has a principal selected, a proposal lodged, and government funding earmarked – $153 million for 15 new and 35 converted schools, no less – all while the existing school is left scrambling for information. The Charter School Authorisation Board is set to 'consult' in November, but one wonders what exactly there is to consult on when the blueprints, and indeed the new foreman, appear to be already in place. The whole thing feels rather predetermined, a fait accompli dressed up as a community engagement exercise. It’s enough to make one wonder if anyone actually listens, or if the whole system is just spectacularly fucked.
