  <h1>Auckland suburb loses Domino&#39;s Pizza</h1>
  <p class="muted">2025-10-29 · properly-fucked</p>
  <p class="lede">The Domino&#39;s Pizza outlet in Red Beach has ceased trading, entering liquidation after failing to cover its operational costs. This closure means creditors, including Inland Revenue, are unlikely to see any repayment.</p>

<section class="satire">
  <p>Ah, Red Beach. A beacon of suburban aspiration, now dimmed by the absence of a truly essential service: its Domino's Pizza. One can only imagine the seismic shift in the local culinary landscape, the profound re-evaluation of Friday night dinner plans. The very fabric of the community, once woven with the scent of pepperoni and questionable garlic bread, now frayed. A tragedy, perhaps, not of Shakespearean proportions, but certainly one that leaves a gaping, dough-shaped hole in the collective psyche. The dream, it seems, was simply too ambitious for this particular patch of Auckland.</p>
<p>The official pronouncement, delivered by the esteemed liquidators, carries the gravitas of a final judgment: sales were 'insufficient to cover the company’s overheads and expenses.' A truly groundbreaking insight, that. Who knew a business needed to make more money than it spent? One pictures the directors, Jaspreet Singh Minhas and Kulwinder Singh, poring over spreadsheets, perhaps even consulting ancient texts, only to arrive at this startling conclusion. Their assets, it turns out, were all leased – a bold strategy, relying entirely on the ephemeral nature of hot pizzas and the unwavering loyalty of the local populace.</p>
<p>And so, the grand reckoning arrives. Inland Revenue, ever the diligent tax collector, finds itself $37,000 poorer, a mere pittance in the grand scheme of national finance, but a significant sum when measured in failed pizza dreams. The liquidators, with a weary sigh that echoes through the hallowed halls of insolvency, declare that 'we do not anticipate a distribution to any class of creditor.' A polite way of saying everyone's fucked. The only thing left to distribute, one presumes, is the lingering aroma of dashed hopes and perhaps a few stale pizza boxes, if they weren't leased too.</p>

    <h3>What’s fucked</h3>
    <p>A business failed to generate enough revenue to cover its basic operating costs, leading to its closure and liquidation. Inland Revenue is out $37,000, and other potential creditors are also unlikely to be repaid, as the company possessed no assets of its own to liquidate. The entire venture was fundamentally flawed, leaving creditors completely fucked with no recourse.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>What might unfuck</h3>
    <p>Better financial management, more realistic projections, or a higher volume of sales could have prevented the business from going into liquidation. Owning assets rather than leasing everything would at least offer some recovery for creditors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>Odds of unfucking</h3>
    <p>For the current situation, the odds are zero. The company is in liquidation, and creditors are explicitly told not to expect any payout. The money is gone, and the business is defunct. The directors are thoroughly fucked, and so are the creditors.</p>
