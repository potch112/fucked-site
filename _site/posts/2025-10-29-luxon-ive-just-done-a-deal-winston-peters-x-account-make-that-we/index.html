  <h1>Luxon: &#39;I&#39;ve just done a deal&#39;. Winston Peters’ X account: Make that &#39;We...&#39;</h1>

  <p class="lede">Foreign Minister Winston Peters’ official X account briefly reshared Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s post about a trade agreement with Southeast Asian nations, adding the word “We…” before deleting it. Both Peters’ and Luxon’s offices later declined to comment on the incident.</p>

<p>New Zealand’s foreign policy took a quick detour through the petty aisle this week, when Winston Peters’ official X account briefly corrected the Prime Minister like a grumpy group-project partner. Christopher Luxon had just posted a proud selfie with Southeast Asian leaders, declaring “<em>I’ve just done a deal</em>,” and somewhere in Wellington a faint voice muttered, “<em>We…</em>” before the post vanished faster than coalition unity after a press conference.When questioned, Peters’ team said they were “unaware,” which is political for <em>please stop asking</em>, while MFAT helpfully clarified, “We are the ministry, not the minister”—a phrase that sounds less like a statement and more like an emotional boundary. Luxon’s office, meanwhile, responded with the timeless statesmanlike phrase “no comment,” proving that silence really is the last functioning arm of government.In short: one man claimed credit for the trade deal, another subtweeted him with grammar, and the rest of us got a live-a</p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>What’s fucked:</strong> It’s politically awkward. The Foreign Minister appeared to publicly correct the Prime Minister’s phrasing on a major diplomatic announcement, implying the trade success was a joint effort, not Luxon’s alone. Deleting the post suggests someone recognised it as undermining cabinet unity or embarrassing in the context of coalition discipline.</li>
    <li><strong>What might unfuck:</strong> Joint messaging: issue a follow-up post or statement framing the trade outcome as a coordinated government achievement rather than Luxon’s personal deal.Internal discipline: tighten approval protocols for ministerial social-media use to prevent future contradictions.External optics: have Peters publicly echo Luxon’s framing at the next media opportunity, showing unity without acknowledging the slip.</li>
    <li><strong>Odds of unfucking:</strong> 1% this year</li>
