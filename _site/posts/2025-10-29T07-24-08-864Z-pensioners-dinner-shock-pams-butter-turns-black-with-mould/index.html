  <h1>Pensioner’s dinner shock: Pams butter turns black with mould</h1>
  <p class="muted">2025-10-29 · properly-fucked</p>
  <p class="lede">Margaret Brain, a 73-year-old pensioner, encountered a rather unappetising surprise when her Pams butter, intended for a simple dinner, was found blackened with mould. This unsettling discovery occurred despite the product bearing a best-before date nearly a year in the future.</p>

<section class="satire">
  <p>Ah, the humble block of butter. A staple, a comfort, a silent promise of smooth, golden indulgence. Margaret Brain, 73, from Hastings, approached her dinner with quiet anticipation. But alas, the universe had other plans. Instead of familiar, creamy yellow, she was greeted by a culinary anathema: a 500g block, blackened with mould at its very core. One must appreciate the exquisite irony of a product, packed on April 7th and deemed 'best before' April 7th <em>next year</em>, achieving such decomposition with remarkable haste. It’s impressive how thoroughly fucked the quality control must have been.</p>
<p>&quot;You expect mould on cheese maybe but not on butter,&quot; she rightly observed, articulating the fundamental tenets of dairy expectation. Yet, when confronted with this domestic horror, the official response from Foodstuffs is, predictably, a masterclass in corporate deflection. &quot;Alert a team member immediately for proper investigation,&quot; they intone, as if Mrs. Brain should have paused mid-gag to conduct a forensic examination. The sheer disconnect is breathtaking. One pictures a beleaguered team member, clipboard in hand, arriving at Mrs. Brain’s kitchen, ready to document the fungal insurrection. Meanwhile, Mrs. Brain simply wants her $8.99 back.</p>
<p>The whispers on the online community group suggest a possible culprit: a &quot;higher water content.&quot; Ah, the relentless march of progress! Less butter, more water, same price, and now, apparently, a delightful side of microbial growth. And yet, the truly poignant detail is Mrs. Brain's weary resignation: &quot;It probably won’t stop me buying Pams because it’s the cheaper option but I’ll keep an eye on it.&quot; This, dear reader, is the true state of affairs. The consumer, having been thoroughly let down, will return, not out of loyalty, but out of economic necessity. It's a perfectly fucked system, really.</p>

    <h3>What’s fucked</h3>
    <p>The immediate issue is a 500g block of Pams butter, purchased for $8.99, found blackened with mould days after purchase, despite a best-before date nearly a year away. This suggests a significant breakdown in food safety or quality control, which is frankly fucked. Margaret Brain's trust in the brand has been shaken, and there are online community reports and speculation about a "higher water content" in the butter, indicating a potential systemic quality issue. Furthermore, the weary reality that a pensioner, having experienced such a gross discovery, still feels compelled to buy the same brand because it's the "cheaper option" highlights a deeper, more fucked economic reality for many. The generic corporate advice to "alert a team member immediately for proper investigation" feels like a wholly inadequate response to such a fundamental product failure.</p>

    <h3>What might unfuck</h3>
    <p>A thorough and transparent investigation by Foodstuffs and Pams into the manufacturing and packaging process could identify the root cause of the mould contamination, particularly if "higher water content" is indeed a factor. Implementing robust corrective measures would restore some faith. Promptly providing Margaret Brain with a refund or replacement, and perhaps a gesture of goodwill, would address her immediate grievance. Increased consumer vigilance, as Margaret herself plans, might also pressure suppliers to maintain higher standards.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>Odds of unfucking</h3>
    <p>Low to moderate. While Foodstuffs states they take food safety seriously and encourage reporting, the generic nature of their response doesn&#39;t inspire immediate confidence in systemic change. The suggestion of &quot;higher water content&quot; points to a potential cost-cutting measure which is difficult to reverse without impacting price. Margaret&#39;s own intention to continue buying the cheaper Pams, despite her shaken trust, indicates that economic necessity often trumps quality concerns for consumers, reducing pressure on the brand. Unless widespread and severe reports force a significant, public overhaul, isolated refunds and investigations are unlikely to unfuck the broader issue.</p>
