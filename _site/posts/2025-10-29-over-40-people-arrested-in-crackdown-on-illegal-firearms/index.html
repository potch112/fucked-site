  <h1>Over 40 people arrested in crackdown on illegal firearms</h1>
  <p class="muted">2025-10-29 · properly-fucked</p>
  <p class="lede">A week-long transnational crackdown, dubbed Operation Black Onyx, saw New Zealand police, in conjunction with Australian counterparts, target illicit firearms. The operation resulted in dozens of arrests and the recovery of nearly a hundred guns, parts, and ammunition.</p>

<section class="satire">
  <p><p>One must commend the sheer audacity of 'Operation Black Onyx', a week-long endeavour that, by all accounts, 'disrupted' a staggering 43 individuals. Imagine the relief across Aotearoa as 96 illicit firearms, a veritable arsenal of shotguns, rifles, and pistols, were painstakingly removed from the hands of the criminally inclined. It’s almost as if the problem of illegal weaponry is a finite, manageable entity, easily contained by a focused seven-day effort and the diligent application of 83 search warrants. The numerical precision – 110 charges, 15 firearm parts – lends an air of incontrovertible triumph.</p>
<p>And what a partnership it was, with Kiwi and Aussie officers joining forces. Detective Inspector Andrew Alexander, a man clearly unburdened by irony, lauded the &quot;real time example&quot; of the Firearms Registry's benefits. One pictures a digital ledger, ticking down the grand total of all illegal guns in the nation, each seizure a satisfying subtraction. It’s almost quaint, this belief that a registry, a mere database, can &quot;hold individuals to account&quot; when they are already operating well outside the bounds of any official record.</p>
<p>The language itself, a masterful blend of corporate speak and law enforcement jargon, paints a picture of a well-oiled machine, smoothly &quot;utilising our intelligence-led approach&quot; to ensure the streets are safe. One wonders, however, what constitutes an &quot;intelligence-led approach&quot; when 96 guns are deemed a success. Were these the <em>only</em> 96 guns? Or merely the low-hanging fruit, the easily identifiable transgressors? The implication is that a brief, intense burst of activity has somehow recalibrated the entire landscape of illicit firearms, rather than merely skimming a few items off the top of a much larger, murkier pool. It’s a performance, certainly, designed to reassure rather than to genuinely solve.</p>

    <h3>What’s fucked</h3>
    <p>The very necessity of a transnational operation to seize 96 guns and arrest 43 people clearly indicates a deeply entrenched problem with illicit firearms in Aotearoa. This isn't a one-off anomaly; it's a symptom of a system that's already pretty fucked, where illegal weapons are sufficiently prevalent to warrant such an extensive, week-long effort.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>What might unfuck</h3>
    <p>The continued 'intelligence-led approach' and the utilisation of the Firearms Registry, as touted by police, represent the theoretical mechanisms that *might* begin to unfuck this situation. If these tools genuinely lead to targeted disruption and accountability, rather than just periodic skirmishes, there's a slim chance of progress.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>Odds of unfucking</h3>
    <p>Given the scale implied by the need for such an operation, and the limited numbers seized relative to the likely wider problem, the odds of genuinely unfucking the illicit firearms issue based on this single operation are fairly low. It’s a minor win in what appears to be a much larger, ongoing battle, suggesting the problem remains properly fucked.</p>
