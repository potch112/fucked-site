  <h1>The curious case of Oriini Kaipara’s ‘repossessed’ campaign truck</h1>
  <p class="muted">2025-10-29 · properly-fucked</p>
  <p class="lede">A truck used in Te Pāti Māori MP Oriini Kaipara’s Tāmaki Makaurau by-election campaign was briefly listed for sale as a repossessed vehicle before being removed from Turners and Trade Me. Questions remain over the truck’s ownership and Kaipara’s connection to its late owner, former Head Hunters member Wynyard Anania.</p>

<section class="satire">
  <p>In the ever-expanding museum of how New Zealand politics manages to get quietly, efficiently, and magnificently fucked, the Oriini Kaipara truck saga deserves its own wing. It began as a feel-good story: a candidate driving a big, blessed waka through Tāmaki Makaurau, wrapped in pride and poster vinyl. Then someone noticed that the same truck — still wearing her face — had popped up on Turners listed as “reposessed, sold on behalf of a finance company.” That’s when it started to smell properly, bureaucratically fucked. Kaipara swore it wasn’t her truck. Fair enough, except she’d recently blessed it, dedicated her campaign to its late owner (a reformed Head Hunters member turned political aide), and posted a heartfelt tribute calling him “Koro Win.” Somewhere in the mix, the finance company reclaimed the truck, the auction listings vanished after Stuff asked questions, and everyone involved suddenly remembered they had absolutely no idea who owned what. The party treasurer said it was all a</p>

    <h3>What’s fucked</h3>
    <p>It’s messy on several levels. A campaign vehicle tied to a sitting MP turns out to have been financed, repossessed, and linked to a deceased former gang member—all while the MP publicly blessed it in his memory but later claimed no knowledge of its ownership. The rapid delisting and unclear accountability make the whole situation look opaque, poorly managed, and politically risky.</p>

  <div class="fact">
    <h3>What might unfuck</h3>
    <p>They could unfuck it by coming clean fast. A simple, consistent explanation of who owned the truck, who authorised its use, and why it was repossessed would drain the drama. Owning the mistake publicly would make it look like miscommunication, not misconduct.</p>

    <h3>Odds of unfucking</h3>
    <p>29%</p>
