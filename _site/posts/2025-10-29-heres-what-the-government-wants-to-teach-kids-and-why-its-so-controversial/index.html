  <h1>Here&#39;s what the Government wants to teach kids, and why it&#39;s so controversial</h1>
  <p class="muted">2025-10-29 · properly-fucked</p>
  <p class="lede">The Government&#39;s proposed curriculum overhaul for New Zealand&#39;s schools, intended as a &quot;refresh,&quot; has instead landed squarely in the political firing line. What our children should learn, from history to sexuality, is now a heated debate, with educators warning of chaos and some aspects leaving the system feeling properly fucked.</p>

<section class="satire">
  <p><p>With the ACT Party celebrating the removal of &quot;Marxist&quot; ideology and the Aotearoa Histories programme, one can only assume the new curriculum will focus on subjects less likely to provoke critical thought, such as the glorious history of tax cuts and the economic benefits of not knowing what consent is. It's truly a refreshing take on education, if &quot;refreshing&quot; means &quot;actively unlearning things.&quot;</p>

    <h3>What’s fucked</h3>
    <p>What's truly fucked is the apparent political prioritisation over educational best practice, leading to a "rushed rollout" and warnings of "chaos" from teachers. The decision to axe the Aotearoa Histories programme, which ensured teaching of New Zealand's own history and the impacts of colonisation, feels particularly short-sighted. Furthermore, the coalition government's earlier axing of sexuality education guidelines, combined with ongoing debate about how and when to teach consent, leaves young people vulnerable and the whole situation feeling rather fucked.</p>

  <div class="fact">
    <h3>What might unfuck</h3>
    <p>The fact that the curriculum is still in draft form means there's a slim window for feedback to influence its final shape, particularly regarding the contentious points of history and sexuality education. Education Minister Stanford has stated consent will be taught, suggesting some recognition of its importance, even if the "how" remains hotly debated.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="fact">
    <h3>Odds of unfucking</h3>
    <p>Given the highly politicised nature of the curriculum design and the &quot;rushed rollout&quot; concerns, the odds of genuinely unfucking this situation to the satisfaction of all stakeholders appear slim. It seems more likely to be a series of compromises that leave no one truly happy.</p>
